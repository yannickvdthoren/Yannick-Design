    <h2 class="title">Rethinking the experience of the newspaper website</h2>
    <div class="introduction">
      <p>At the end of my contract with Le Télégramme <em>— back in 2015 —</em> and as my workload diminished, I decided to try to imagine what should be done to enhance the experience of the user on the website.</p>
      <p>By exploring what was being made by other newspapers around the world, I found a path to follow. I also had the chance to get my hand on previous study done by the marketing on our end users. All of this leaded me to create the following mock-ups.</p>

    <div class="video">
      <p>During my stay, when I had the time, I tried to reinvent some part of the website : how to have a punchy homepage with those ad rules, how to simplify the menu, to showcase the news for the favorite cities of the reader, etc…</p>
      <p>Let say, I had nothing but a solution and then one day, I fell on a video that just put me on a path...</p>
      <p>This is a video from Artem Troinoi that explore the possible future of the NY Times by letting the user personnalise the infos the homepage show him. He has the idea of letting the user change the order of news he wanted to see, the size of the content, to only see a section of the website without having to charge the whole page again and many more. I let you take a closer look at the video.</p>

    <div class="sondage">
      <p>As said earlier, I also had my hand on some sondages made on the usability of the website. I also went talking with the journalist that were all around me in the office. I mean, they read plenty of newspapers everyday from all over the web, who know better what works and don’t ?</p>
      <p>In the end, I had a pile of interesting track to follow : giving the freedom to the user to do whatever he want, focusing on more news from the cities of the users, maybe more sport as well, this section of the website with the hobbies that should be enhanced like blogs.</p>
      <p>I decided to take an in-between path with the video and the fact that people wanted more info about their cities. Also, at this time, the technology to create an ultra personalised website was not really easy to integrate.</p>

      <h3>THE NAVBAR</h3>

      <p>My first mission at the newspaper was to work on a new navbar and the end result was horrific. There is so many links in the header that you don’t really know where you have to clic. Knowing that the human brain is lost when more than 7 choices is given to him at the same time I was totally astonished to hear that I had to put 12 choices on the same line + a line with 8+ choices for the cities, etc…
      <br>
      <br>At this time UX was only beginning to enter in the game and they never heard about it where I was working. So, the first thing I wanted to change was that Christmas wreaths we have.</p>

      <p>First, I created a bar for the “members”. Meaning that you find the cities with a max of 5 choices in the header + the link to log in or getting a paid plan.</p>

      <p>That way, I had plenty of room again to create a menu with breathable space around each link and still 8 choices. Minus the fact that the home button is an icon so disappear from your choices when you take a look at the menu.</p>

      <p>Second. The editorial team wanted to create a sub-menu with the sub-category of each category. Actually, it appears under the menu, I displaced it in a new section menu that was not in the navbar but on the side of each section title. You gain space in the menu and the sub-menu is exactly where it should be, only in the section and still two click away from the homepage.</p>

    <div class="homepage">
      <h3>THE HOMEPAGE</h3>
      <p>Less noise more space to the news ! One thing I like more than everything on the web is having a big picture speaking more than a hundred words on the top of a website a bit like Nat Geo can do with those beautiful cover. I wanted the same for the website. A big cover with only a title pushing you to go further. And I designed two of them, because, why not !</p>
      <p>For the Live news, I decided that it would benefit to be on the left side of the website, an area where your eyes is automatically attracted. And then only after that you got your news with a new format for the images giving more emphasis to the news, feeling like a real newspaper.</p>
      <p>And the marketing link, newsletters, etc… They got their own space at the end of the section.</p>

    <div class="town">
      <h3>Your Town</h3>
      <p>Here is the biggest add-on to the website. Your town is a section on the homepage where you can personalise some of the news you see. By selecting your favorite town, you get the local news and sports news about those cities all at ones. No need to take a look to each page to see if something happened, everything is here.</p>

    <div class="general">
      <h3>GENERAL NEWS</h3>
      <p>For the section talking about the world, the country, etc… Nothing really changed except that each of these was divided into section, paving the way to create an homepage personalisation system.</p>
      <p>One thing that changed is that I added a Sport section to each of them so you got your world sport news in the world news, France sport in France, etc… with a score viewing bundle. I found it easier that way but it has to be tested for real to see if this way of showing sport infos is accurate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="city">
      <h3>TOWN PAGES</h3>
      <p>The way we showed the towns news pages were a nightmare. You had all the news from one town in a looooooong news feed with no way of filter it. If you wanted to find an infos about sport, you had to scroll to the info. Crazy Right ?</p>
      <p>I decided to create a sub-menu for the cities using the most common news you should want to get : News, Sports, Weather Forecast, Cinema, Agenda and Obituary.</p>

    <div class="one-more-thing">
      <h3>One more thing</h3>
      <p>I didn’t have the time to fully finish my reflexion, especially for the hobbies section. I wanted it to look like each of the categories were actually blogs with their own design and way of showing informations. I think that way people would be able to only follow the one they really care about. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against having lots of hobbies but if I like to watch movies, I may not be that interested in having cooking news when I look for the last trailers of the week…</p>
    </div>

    <div class="today">
      <h3>One more thing</h3>
      <p>Today, the site that existed when I left has really changed. The way news are shown to people has evolve in a more readable way. You find your way through the website with ease. And although some pages need to be improved, a big step forward has been made since I left.</p>
